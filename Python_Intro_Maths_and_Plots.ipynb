    "# Introduction to Python for using equations and plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will start to explore some stuff about Geochronology. In particular it is important to get used to how we can use vectors (lists of numbers) and apply equations. We will then also see how to approach making attractive graphs and figures using the results. This session is designed to augment and support your learning in the Quantitative Geomorphology workshop while also familiarising you with the python software environment that will be used in subsequent labs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Intended Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended learning outcomes of this lab are:\n",
    "* To understand how to apply basic equations and mathematical operations in Python to answer scientific questions\n",
    "* To be able to make basic plots of your results and tailor them to be easy to interpret\n",
    "* To understand what a python function is and how to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in the Python computer programming language, but you don't need any prior knowledge of computer programming. Learning how to be a programmer is not the aim! However, this sort of scientific computing is becoming more common place in research and consultancy, so it won't do you any harm to see it in action. Python is multifunctional, for example it can interface with GIS software to automate workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Notebooks\n",
    "This page is called an **interactive notebook**. It allows us to build a document with descriptive text, equations, and images etc. while also having the ability to do some calculations as we go along. It's a bit like embedding some Microsoft Excel calculations into a Microsoft Word document! Thus you will find (and use) blocks of computer code (the formula bar in Excel is a simple form of computer programming!). In this case the computer code we will use is a particular programming language called Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside blocks of python code there are comments indicated by lines that start with `#`. These lines are not computer code but rather comments providing information about what the code is doing to help you follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To run a code block, click in a cell, hold down shift, and press enter.** An asterisk in square brackets `In [*]:` will appear while the code is being executed, and this will change to a number `In [1]:` when the code is finished. *The order in which you execute the code blocks matters, they must be run in sequence.* \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modules\n",
    "Now that we are starting to do some more interesting things like mathematics and plotting, we need to make sure we have to correct tools available. **Modules** are python libraries containing computer code that we might want to use for lots of different activities (a bit like \"Add-ins\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two **Modules** we will use today.\n",
    "- **NumPy** (short for numerical python) contains all the tools we need for working with numbers and doing maths\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** (short for mathematical plotting library) contains all the tools we need for data visualisation. If you want to get a sense of the variety of graphs/plots/charts you can make with `matplotlib`, take a quick look at [**the matplotlib gallery**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these **Modules** available, we need to `import` them. When we import them we will give them a shorthand name by importing them `as` an abbreviation, so that we dont have to type their full name out everytime we want to use thes tools:"

    "\n",
    "You have been learning about different geochronology tools available to geomorphologists to help us understand the age of landforms at the Earth surface, or quantify rates of erosion/deposition. Let's start by considering radiocarbon dating.\n",
    "\n",
    "While an organism is alive, the relative amount of <sup>14</sup>C (i.e. the ratio of <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) is in isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric carbon. The atmosphere contains roughly one <sup>14</sup>C atom for every trillion <sup>12</sup>C atoms, giving a <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio of approximately $1.2 \\times 10 ^{-12}$. After the organism dies, and carbon exchange with the atmosphere ceases, <sup>14</sup>C undegoes radioactive decay and the relative amount of <sup>14</sup>C (i.e. the ratio of <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) declines. The rate of decline is controlled by the half-life of <sup>14</sup>C which is 5730 years (± 40 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists have demonstrated that the decay can be modelled mathematically using a exponential (i.e. non-linear) function:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In equation 1, $N$ is the number of parent isotopes over time $t$ [years]. $N_0$ is the initial number of isotopes (when the organism died) in units of [atoms gram<sup>-1</sup>], and $\\lambda$ is the decay constant which relates to to the half-life of <sup>14</sup>C ($\\lambda = 1.21 \\times 10^{-4}$ years<sup>-1</sup>).\n",
    "\n",
    "For those with less experience of mathematics, $e$ is a special number in maths called Euler's number $e \\approx 2.718$ that applies to many natural growth/decay phenomena where the change in something is dependent on how much of that something there is (e.g. the decay of radiocarbon depends on how much radiocarbon is left).\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's implement this equation in Python to calculate the decay of <sup>14</sup>C after an organism has died. First we will declare our constants and initial conditions:"
