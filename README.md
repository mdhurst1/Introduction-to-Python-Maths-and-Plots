# Introduction-to-Python-Maths-and-Plots
This interactive python notebook serves as an Introduction to Python for geoscientists.
It is an exercise in EARTH4090 Landscape Dynamics, an honours level course on the Environemental Geoscience degree in the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the Univrsity of Glasgow.

## Overview of the lab
In this lab we will start to explore some stuff about Radiocarbon dating. In particular it is important to get used to implementing equations and plotting their results. We will also introduce functions.

The code is written in the Python computer programming language, but you don't need any prior knowledge of computer programming. 

### Intended Learning Outcomes
The intended learning outcomes of this lab are:
* To understand how to apply basic equations and mathematical operations in Python to answer scientific questions
* To be able to make basic plots of your results and tailor them to be easy to interpret
* To understand what a python function is and how to use it
